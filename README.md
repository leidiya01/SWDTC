# README for Phased Analysis and Prediction of Green Finance via Sliding Window Decision Tree and Clustering

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying the developmental stages of green finance across Chinese provinces using machine learning techniques. The primary methods employed include K-means clustering and decision tree models, enhanced with a sliding window mechanism for temporal data analysis. The study categorizes the green finance development into four distinct stages and identifies key transition indicators, providing actionable insights for policymakers.

## Features
- **Clustering Analysis**: Uses K-means clustering to classify green finance development into four stages—Embryonic, Growth, Deepening, and Maturity.
- **Decision Tree Model**: Incorporates sliding window features for improved temporal prediction accuracy and robustness.
- **Key Indicators**: Highlights critical indicators such as green credit, green insurance, and green bonds as primary transition factors.
- **Regional Focus**: Analyzes 31 provincial-level administrative regions in mainland China, spanning 1990–2021.
- **Temporal Insights**: Enhances understanding of green finance progression over time using sliding window analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset includes economic and green finance-related data from the National Bureau of Statistics and Provincial Statistical Yearbooks, covering the period from 1990 to 2021.

## Results
The analysis reveals that China's green finance development can be segmented into four stages with distinctive characteristics:
1. **Embryonic Stage**: Low levels of green financial instruments indicating early development stages.
2. **Growth Stage**: Increasing use of green credits, bonds, and funds reflecting rising governmental and financial support.
3. **Deepening Stage**: Significant investments in green projects and insurance indicating mature environmental governance.
4. **Maturity Stage**: High levels of all green indicators reflecting well-established green finance systems.

## Usage
